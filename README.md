## Functionality

 - Connect 4 game (AI coming in future!)
 - Tic Tac Toe (with an AI, difficulty modes coming soon!)
 - Rock Paper Scissors
 - ~~Voting to create channel!~~ (feature removed due to potentially creating ping spam in its form as it was previously)

## Running the Bot

You can get the dependencies automatically by going to the path in your terminal, then running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you add a new package, please add it to [the requirements.txt file](https://github.com/aaguy-hue/Gamily-Ever-After/blob/master/requirements.txt).

The bot depends on the following things:
 - Python (programming language)
 - discord.py (interface to Discord API)

Note: The python-dotenv package is no longer used after the rewrite and will be removed from the requirements.txt along with its dependencies in future.
